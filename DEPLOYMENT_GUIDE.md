# ðŸš€ Tic-Tac-Toe Enhanced - Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

- Sui CLI installed and configured
- Sui wallet with testnet SUI for gas fees
- Node.js and npm installed for frontend

## Step 1: Deploy Enhanced Smart Contracts

### Run the deployment script:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Or deploy manually:
```bash
cd tic_tac
sui move build
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

### Save the contract addresses from the output:
- Package ID
- Treasury ID
- Leaderboard ID
- Admin Cap ID

## Step 2: Update Frontend Constants

Update `src/config/constants.ts` with the new contract addresses:

```typescript
export const CONTRACT_CONFIG = {
  PACKAGE_ID: "0x...", // Your new package ID
  TREASURY_ID: "0x...", // Your treasury ID
  LEADERBOARD_ID: "0x...", // Your leaderboard ID
  ADMIN_CAP_ID: "0x...", // Your admin cap ID
  NETWORK: "testnet" as const,
} as const;
```

## Step 3: Test the Deployment

### Run the Move tests:
```bash
cd tic_tac
sui move test
```

### Start the frontend:
```bash
cd tic-tac-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

2. **"Object not found" errors**
   - Verify contract addresses in constants.ts
   - Check if objects exist on-chain

3. **Language selector not working**
   - Ensure LanguageProvider wraps the app in layout.tsx
   - Check localStorage permissions

4. **Leaderboard empty**
   - Leaderboard populates after competitive games
   - Check LEADERBOARD_ID in constants

5. **Admin panel access denied**
   - Only AdminCap owner can access
   - Check if you received AdminCap during deployment

## Production Deployment

### For mainnet deployment:

1. **Change network in constants.ts**:
   ```typescript
   NETWORK: "mainnet" as const,
   ```

2. **Deploy to mainnet**:
   ```bash
   sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
   ```

3. **Update all contract addresses**

4. **Test thoroughly on mainnet**

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the deployment logs
2. Verify all contract addresses
